# Mobile View

These set of scripts allow you to use the full capabilities of the Trilium server user interface while on a mobile device. 

## What the scripts do

* On startup, Set the zoom and viewport to match the size of your mobile device
* Shows only one pane at a time according to which view you select
* Enables overflow for the left hand sidebar, improving readability for long page titles


## How to Use
Add the scripts as directed by the comments at the top of each file, then reload Trilium. After launch, you will have 4 additional buttons on the sidebar. 

* Toggle Mobile View - This allows you to toggle between the full desktop view and the mobile view
* Set Sidebar View - Shows the left sidebar with the page hierarchy
* Set Note View - Shows the note contents, labels and tabs
* Set Right Panel - Shows the right panel along with any widgets such as the Table of Contents

Note, these scripts are intended to be used while Trilium web is in Desktop mode, not Mobile mode. Switch the mode to Desktop mode in the Trilium options menu before enabling mobile view from the launcher.
